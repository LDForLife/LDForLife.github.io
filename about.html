    <h2>History of Sovereign Woman Services LLC</h2>
    <p>
        Sovereign Woman Services LLC was established with a deep-seated commitment to effecting positive change in communities.

        Founder Marie Jean-Louis launched the company in 2022 in Miami, Florida. As a single mother from a low-income background, Marie intimately understood the challenges of securing suitable housing. Her work is rooted in extensive research and education across the complexities of the housing market, zoning regulations, and construction methodologies. This pursuit of knowledge was pivotal in assembling a team of passionate professionals, including architects, designers, and financial experts.

    <h2>Meet the Founder & CEO: Marie A. JeanLouis</h2>
    <div class="founder-bio">
        <p>
            Born and raised in Haiti as the sixth of eight siblings, Marie embarked on a life-altering journey to the United States in 2000 at the age of 27, with her 2-year-old son, Louis, by her side. She navigated life in a new country as a single mother, facing rejection from government assistance programs, juggling two jobs, and attending school full-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite aspiring to business and public speaking, circumstances led her to a nursing career. In 2017, the same year her son enlisted in the Army, Marie achieved a significant milestone by graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Nursing. Her diverse nursing experiences span acute care, long-term care, psychiatric, and correctional travel nursing, equipping her with a broad perspective on healthcare and community service needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, her journey of perseverance and deep understanding of family struggles drives the company's commitment to making a meaningful impact in the affordable housing market.
